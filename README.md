File Secure can be used to encrypt and decrypt your files using AES 128, 192 and 256

Following modifications have been introduced in the current version
1. An Intuitive GUI has been Introduced for ease of non-developer users
2. Parallel Processing has been Introduced to Optimize the Application

Prerequisites:Python 3 with following libraries tkinter, copy, math, random and concurrent.futures 

Run the Application: python FileSecure.py

Steps to perform Encryption
1. Select the AES encryption key as per the security needs between available encryption schemes (128, 192 and 256)
2. Select the file which needs to be encrypted
3. Select the folder where encrypted file and key needs to be stored
4. Press Start Encryption

Steps to perform decryption
